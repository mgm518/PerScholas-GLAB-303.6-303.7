# Lesson 303.6 & 303.7 - Java Arrays & Array Processing and Manipulation

This assignment focuses on working with arrays by using various iterative processes, plus some practice using Streams.  
We are to complete tasks 1-7 in the [worksheet](Docs/PA%20303.7.1%20-%20Practice%20Assignment%20-%20Array.pdf), but I've also completed 8-11 as well.

There is a [HackerRank - Java Subarray](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/java-negative-subarray/problem) That was found at the end of the lesson. As of now (03/22/24), this is assigned or mentioned, but I decided to complete it anyway for extra practice. That will be the `subarray()` method in the code.
